	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>I used to think this was the perfect game, and I still think it&#039;s excellent. The theme could be integrated with the gameplay a little better though. It just feels like you&#039;re playing cards and not actually building a civilization. That said, for what it is, it&#039;s superb and a must-have in any collection because it plays so smoothly and quickly even at higher player counts. It&#039;s simple enough to be a &quot;gateway plus&quot; game, but meaty enough for experienced gamers. The game design supports multiple winning strategies and rewards smart play.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I grew up reading cyberpunk SF by William Gibson (Neuromancer, Johnny Mnemonic, Burning Chrome) and Neal Stephenson (Snow Crash, The Diamond Age), so I love the theme of this game! The rules are more complicated than they need to be, and they can be surprisingly difficult to learn. It doesn&#039;t help that Fantasy Flight&#039;s rule book is poorly structured and way too vague, and the card text isn&#039;t any better. But gameplay is deep and worth the effort. I find the draw mechanism to be a little too luck-based than I would prefer, and deck customization isn&#039;t as easy as Star Wars: The Card Game. Playing as the Corporation is passive and may not appeal to players who prefer more active gameplay.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I have a surprising amount of fun playing this game, even though I wouldn&#039;t call it a very well designed game. For some reason, I really got into the theme. I think you need to add some of the expansions to the game to make it meaty enough in order to have enough information to make it a proper deduction game. I would not play again without the clinic trials. Without them, there just isn&#039;t enough information being traded between the players, so you often just need to go with your gut feeling. As such, the game often feels too random. Player A might get dealt two X cards and a syringe at the beginning of the game, and player B might just get a bunch of numbered cards. Guess who is more likely to win? Hint: It&#039;s not player B!</comment>				</item>

Usually, once players start to be eliminated, the game ends quickly soon after, unless you&#039;re playing with 7-8 players. Not so bad with 4-5 players though.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Adding hidden traitors to a co-operative game is brilliant and perfectly thematic for this game! The rulebook is somewhat labyrinthine (especially when you include an expansion or two) and the rules can be difficult to learn, but, once you&#039;ve figured it out, it&#039;s fantastic. It can play very long, however, especially if you&#039;re looking up rules a lot. I&#039;d love to play it more often, but it can be hard to get it to the table due to the length.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s the perfect game to play at a Halloween-themed game night. It&#039;s pretty much worth having in your collection just for that, especially if you can find it on sale. The game is best played for the experience, not winning or losing. Some of the haunts (scenarios) are wonky, but some are fantastic. It&#039;s uneven in that regard, but there are so many different scenarios that I can easily forgive it for the added replayability you get as a result.

I really like the sense of exploration that you get in the first half (or so) of the game. It&#039;s very evocative and fun, and, for me, it&#039;s the best part. My enjoyment usually decreases somewhat once the haunt begins. I just want to keep exploring, personally, but I understand you have to end the game somehow.

I do wish the components were better. I wish they would do a new edition or a deluxe edition which fixes some of the problems and improves the components, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s likely to happen anytime soon.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Solid design, but it could be a little more streamlined. It took us a long time to learn the rules, and the many options induced analysis paralysis, occasionally. I love the dice allocation though. It&#039;s very interactive, but overly so.

Strategy thoughts:

First round goal: Try to have at least one man and one woman with useful actions by the end of the first round. The most useful actions are building and getting another man/woman (procreating?), I feel, because those actions free up your dice to be used for other actions. I got a man who let me build in the second round, and I used him every round for the remainder of the game. A person who does expanding (a pathfinder) or one that gets you resources or status is probably in the next tier of most useful actions, but you&#039;ll probably need to double them up with an identical person or a green god card to make them top-tier useful. A woman that gets you one seashell is, IMHO, a waste of space. There are far better ways to get seashells.

Second round goal: Build early and build often. Building early (in rounds 1 and 2) gets you the most points. You should build at least twice by the end of the second round. If you can manage to build three times by the end of the second round, I imagine you&#039;re doing very well indeed. If you can get a man who can build, it&#039;s more efficient to do it that way, I think, and that could potentially allow you to build twice per round in the early rounds. But, by the time you get to the fourth round, you&#039;ll need to double up on builders in order to use the building tokens with the higher die numbers or use a green card.

Third and fourth round goals: Get at least a couple priests into the temple. They&#039;ll pay dividends through the remainder of the game.

Complete as many tasks as you can. I guess this is obvious, huh? But this doubly applies to the end of the game. Make sure you have at least one yellow god card going into game-end scoring because that should allow you to score multiple tasks at the end.

Don&#039;t buy any jewelry that gives you only 1 point unless you&#039;re going for the game-end jewelry bonus. The 5-point ones are the minimum you should buy.

Read over the game-end scoring bonuses and keep them in mind. Make it a goal to score a couple of them. Some of them seem more difficult than others to achieve. There&#039;s some synergy between the maximum building and the completely-filling-in-your-ceremony-spaces game-end bonuses.

Sixth round goal: Expand into regions with lots of fishing points. This is probably the most efficient way to score points in the last round, especially if you have some red god cards or purple god tiles to effectively score the fishing twice. Try not to be first on the status track at the end of this round. In fact, if you can be last, none of the other players will be able to take away your fishing points (unless they move using a man/woman action in the next phase).

All the god cards are useful, but I feel the white cards are slightly more useful than the others. They let you maximize your helper actions and get you into the leftmost spot in the temple even when you roll low.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>I love this game, but it&#039;s not without problems. Bruges is a little too tactical, less strategic than I would like, but it&#039;s a joy to play and easy to teach. Every once in a while though, there are times when you really need a purple card in order to get purple workers to run your engine or build that crucial canal, and you just can&#039;t draw a purple card. That can be extremely frustrating. The game would be less frustrating, I think, if there was a way to transform any card into any color of your choice by discarding a card or sacrificing a worker or two of another color or paying a couple guilders. Either that or have stacks of cards in each of the colors off to the side whose fronts are blank, and you can draw one and only one of these blank cards in any color you choose per round. The game can also induce AP in me and my friends like almost no other game.</comment>				</item>

Winning requires probably a little too much luck, but manipulating the timeline is so much fun that I don&#039;t care. Excellent translation of time travel theme to a game. The Gore Years expansion is a must-have.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>The theme breaks down regularly. (Why is Aquaman using Batman&#039;s utility belt? Why is Green Lantern using Aquaman&#039;s trident? Why do villains go in your deck if you&#039;re a hero? That last one bugs me the most.) Too many cards are luck-based. The heroes are wildly unbalanced. Cyborg has a clear advantage over the Flash, for example. A player can run away with the game by defeating certain super-villains like Parallax early in the game. Not enough female heroes. Generally, not a good game, but it can be a nice change of pace. Easy to learn, easy to play. Good artwork. But Star Realms fills the same niche and does so in a much better way.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Oddly, it reminds me of Pandemic with dice. It&#039;s far more thematic, of course. I love it, but it needs more cards (easily rectified by incorporating an expansion or two), and it can play a little long. I&#039;ve had a game take 5 hours!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I want to like this game more than I actually do, I think. I love the theme and the mechanisms, but it never quite seems to coalesce into a game that&#039;s as fun as I would like for some reason. Maybe it&#039;s the lack of *interesting* interaction between players? With Race for the Galaxy and Roll for the Galaxy, I&#039;m trying hard to guess what the other players are going to do, which is inherently thrilling when you guess correctly, and that seemingly is just a lot less important in Eminent Domain.</comment>				</item>

It plays too long for what it is, and it&#039;s a little too luck-based for my tastes. But it is still quite fun, and it&#039;s just dripping with theme. Best paper money ever.</comment>				</item>

The challenge might have been too much for some of friends who found the onslaught to be hopeless. The rules are a mess! Poorly translated, I suspect. I had to resort to watching Rahdo&#039;s runthrough at the table to figure out how to play.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Fun little card game with enough interaction between players that it doesn&#039;t feel like you&#039;re playing solitaire. That level of interaction may be a turn off to some players who don&#039;t like the &quot;take that&quot; style of gameplay, however. It is relatively easy to teach and learn, and it has a surprising amount of depth in terms of strategies and tactics.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s a blast when played with the right group, one that gets into role-playing their monsters and doesn&#039;t take it too seriously. If the group isn&#039;t into the theme though, it will fall flat. Gameplay and strategy just isn&#039;t very deep or compelling otherwise. I prefer to play it with 4-6 players. Player elimination stinks. If you&#039;re knocked out early in the game, it&#039;s not fun having to watch everyone else play. King of New York is just a much improved and more interesting version of this game.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s definitely a well-designed game, and I can&#039;t wait to play again. It plays a little on the long side for what it is, however, and I think it&#039;s also somewhat prone to analysis paralysis. Also, if you fall behind, it seems like it&#039;s very difficult to catch up.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Legendary Encounters is an amazing cooperative deck-building game. If you are a fan of the Alien(s) movies, this is a must-have. The game design incorporates a number of improvements and refinements over Marvel Legendary. Each player has an avatar and a personalized starting deck. That&#039;s a nice improvement. I also like how the Hive deck ramps up in difficulty as you progress through the objectives. The objectives also provide some variety into the gameplay. Scanning to see what the enemies are is brilliantly thematic and adds tension to the gameplay. The ability to &quot;Coordinate&quot; is amazing and really adds to the cooperative nature of the game. It practically eliminates any downtime since you are involved on everyone&#039;s turn. The fact that the game is fully cooperative (when you don&#039;t incorporate the secret goals or traitor variant) isn&#039;t necessarily an improvement over Marvel Legendary, but it can be with the right group. Where the game suffers (compared to Marvel Legendary) is player elimination, unfortunately. It&#039;s no fun for your character to be killed and you have to watch the other players play. There are proposed house rules for eliminating the player elimination, but I haven&#039;t tried them yet. Having a chestbursted player turn into an Alien and play an Alien deck mitigates this somewhat, but only slightly since it&#039;s more likely that a player dies from strikes than a chestburster, and playing as an Alien simply isn&#039;t very fun. The game also currently suffers from the lack of replayability compared to Marvel Legendary&#039;s near infinite replayability. I just don&#039;t think it makes sense thematically to play scenarios that don&#039;t match up with one of the movies. I can&#039;t see ever mixing characters and movie objectives. Ultimately, I think I will get tired of playing the same movie scenarios more than a few times each, but, for now, I love it. It&#039;s possible the planned expansion could significantly improve the replayability. I hope so. As with Marvel Legendary, the game does not scale well with the number of players. The sweet spot seems to be 3 players. Do not play with 5 players unless you do a couple rounds of recruiting first. Solo play doesn&#039;t seem as well implemented as Marvel Legendary. The artwork is very uneven. It ranges from superb for the Aliens to rather poor for some of the characters.

The above comes across as more negative than I actually feel about the game. It&#039;s a really great cooperative and a lot of fun.</comment>				</item>

The various schemes all play differently, so there is a ton of replay value. The hero cards play very thematically. I love the semi-co-operative nature of the game, which can lead to some interesting decisions.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>I kind of have a love/hate relationship with this game. I think it&#039;s a fantastic game for the most part. The artwork is gorgeous, and I love the gameplay, quests, and combat. It&#039;s just really demoralizing and so very frustrating when you lose, but it&#039;s glorious when you win. The game just isn&#039;t very forgiving at all. Kill just one too many monsters or the wrong monster early in the game, and it can be the difference between winning and losing.

The game doesn&#039;t scale very well to the number of players. Legend 2 is easier with 4 players and too difficult with 2 players, but Legend 3 is too difficult with 4 players. In Legend 3, more players means more Fate cards to resolve before you can fight the final Big Bad, and that takes more time and you can only let one monster into the castle before it is overrun. Fate cards which take farmers out of the game are the worst, especially in a 4-player game.

I think the tutorial in Legend 1 is actually very innovative, but I do wish there was a more conventional rule book to go with it. When you need a clarification on some rule, it can be hard to find the rule because all the rules are spread out between the the tutorial, the Standard Setup Legend cards, various other Legend cards, the Battle board, the Merchant board, etc. There&#039;s the 4-page rules summary which attempts to bring everything together, but it&#039;s missing a bunch of rules in my experience.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>One of the best 6 player games ever. Loads of fun, and plays quickly due to mostly simultaneous play. The pirate theme is well integrated and evocative. Unfortunately, the decks are not well balanced at other player counts as some cards are just stronger than others.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Only played this once, so consider this my first impressions. Setup was a chore! I think it took close to 30 minutes to setup, maybe longer, and even longer to figure out the rules (and I was playing with someone who had played it before). I found it an enjoyable and rewarding experience, but it took a very, very long time to play. Although I like the randomized locations of the planets in theory, it made planning what course to take rather more difficult in practice than it should have been (compared to Firefly: The Game).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Fun racing/betting game. It plays quickly and plays well even with a large number of players, potentially making it a nice change of pace for parties, I imagine. I like the variety of terrain and monsters, and the powers each monster has are very thematic. The monsters are probably not well balanced, but maybe it doesn&#039;t matter much.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Although it&#039;s based on Puerto Rico, this game has a much steeper learning curve due to the sheer number of planets, but, once you get the hang of it, it is actually quite elegant. I love the theme, but I&#039;m not sure the theme ever actually comes through that strongly. It feels like I&#039;m just playing cards, not building a galaxy-spanning civilization. The simultaneous, hidden role selection is really what makes the game. The best players try to figure out what roles the other players will select and try to take advantage of those roles while also selecting roles that benefit primarily themselves.</comment>				</item>

2016 Update: Unfortunately, my gaming group and/or I burned out on playing it. I haven&#039;t gotten it to the table in a couple years.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>So much fun to play! Best game of 2015 (so far). I actually like it more than Race for the Galaxy. The dice mitigation mechanisms are very innovative. It doesn&#039;t really play like any other dice game I&#039;ve ever played.

Unfortunately, in my experience (but contrary to the designers&#039;), the produce/consume strategy seems underpowered compared to a simplistic explore/settle strategy. I find that a little frustrating because I enjoy the challenge of finding the worlds that synergize well with each other and gaining and using the appropriately colored dice for producing and shipping to maximize victory points. That just seems a lot more fun to me than just settling a bunch of low-cost worlds as fast as possible, but that simplistic strategy usually wins. I think the game desperately needs an expansion to flesh out and boost alternative strategies.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Very nice co-operative card game. As a comic book reader and collector for almost my entire life, I&#039;m a sucker for the theme. I really appreciate how each hero, villain, and environment plays differently and thematically. Although many people seem to love the artwork, I find it somewhat amateurish (sorry) compared to modern comic book artwork. I appreciate that Greater Than Games came up with their own comic book characters and mythology, but I wish I was playing with familiar DC Comics characters instead.

Some combinations of heroes and villains and locations just don&#039;t play well together, unfortunately, and those setups should be avoided. Learning what those bad combinations are, however, is a process of trial and error.

I have found that the gameplay gets boring with repeated plays. It&#039;s really about the narrative. You need to use your imagination to make the gameplay interesting. It&#039;s also very fiddly with the constant upkeep of hit points and damage buffs and debuffs. I find that aspect of the game draining and not fun. The few combos that each hero has are slow to materialize as you are typically only playing 1 card and drawing 1 card each turn. It&#039;s like playing in slow motion. There&#039;s also often little choice in what you should do.

I recently purchased the iOS app to play on my iPad. It&#039;s superior to the physical game in that you don&#039;t have to keep track of hit points and any damage buffs/debuffs. That speeds up the gameplay considerably and makes it far more enjoyable.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>My first European designer board game. I fell in love with it right away and bought a bunch of expansions for it. Played it many times. A true classic that brought a lot of people to modern boardgames. That said, it feels rather dated now. The winner is often decided as much by the dice as by strategy, which can be frustrating to experienced gamers. It is still worth re-visiting occasionally though. Star Trek Catan, with its character-specific abilities, is a nice improvement on the original design.</comment>				</item>

The Awesome Level 9000 Expansion and the Science Fiction Double Feature Expansion make the game even better and are must-buys. The Obligatory Cthulhu Expansion has been a disappointment, however. It seems the new Cthulhu-inspired factions don&#039;t mix as well with the old factions.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The role selection is definitely an improvement over base Catan, and the roles are well designed to fit the Trek characters they represent. That said, it&#039;s still just Catan with a (mostly) pasted-on theme. The card quality in this version is quite low, but the plastic ships and starbases are very nice.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Only played this once so far, so consider this my first impressions. Very fun cooperative game. I adore the theme. I love the dice allocation mechanism and how each player has a special move. It may be a little too easy though. I would like to see some way of scaling the difficulty perhaps. Next time we play, I&#039;ll try to include the R2-D2/C-3PO expansion for added complexity.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>The Force is strong in this game! Absolutely amazing! &quot;Star Wars in a box&quot; is the perfect description. It evokes the movies incredibly well. It&#039;s beyond epic; it&#039;s a saga! And very cinematic. You can send Luke off to train with Yoda to become, you can plan an assault on the Death Star, and rapidly move the Rebel Base when the Empire gets close to finding it. It&#039;s thrilling and evocative. We truly live in a Golden Age of Board Games. If I could just play this game in about three hours with my friends, it would be perfect. Unfortunately, we play far too slowly to get this to the table more than a couple times per year, I&#039;m guessing. When we do though, I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll love every minute of it.</comment>				</item>

The Edge battles mean there is no such thing as a useless card. The usage of objective sets for building your decks makes the concept very accessible and balanced. Gameplay is smooth and easy to learn.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I feel like a kid playing this game; I love it so much. It&#039;s a great tactical game, but also rather strategic with regards to selecting your ship and pilot upgrades. If I have one complaint about this game, it&#039;s that it takes my friends and I a long time to play, usually 2-3 hours for just 100-point squadrons. We probably just haven&#039;t played it enough.</comment>				</item>

It is so much fun and very satisfying when you build an invention that performs well! I&#039;ve found that the game can be a bear to teach. There&#039;s a lot to go over before you can start playing. Rules could use some streamlining, I think.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>This is my favorite worker placement game! It is a very impressively designed game. I love the thrill you get when you time all of your workers such that you can take them all off the gears in one big, amazing super-move.

I think it plays best with 3 players. The gears are a little too crowded with 4 players, making it more difficult to get on the gears you need to get on, which makes taking the first-player spot a lot more important.</comment>				</item>

I think it&#039;s quite brilliant how the game is more about making good educated guesses than knowing a lot of trivia. That keeps it accessible to a wide range of players.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Wits &amp; Wagers is one of the only party games I like. The rules and gameplay of the original edition is the best, but I got this Party edition because I wanted more questions for the original edition. It helps that it comes with some fresh dry-erase markers, too, and more chips.</comment>				</item>
